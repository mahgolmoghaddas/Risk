Risk is a turn-based game for two to six players. The standard version is played on a board depicting a political map of the Earth, divided into forty-two territories. The objective of the game is to eliminate other players by occupying every territory on the board. Players use armies to attack and defend territories from other players. A random number generator determines the outcomes of battles.
